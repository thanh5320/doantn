# Solutions K-Coverage & MConnectivity :
## Input
- Domain : A = M x H 
- K is constraint with each target 
- M is constraint with number of connection to base 
- T = {T1, T2, T3, ..., Tm} is m target need coverage
- Coverage radius  : Rs
- Connection radius : Rc
- Base = (x, y)
 

## Output 
- Sensors S = {S1, S2, S3, .... Sn} and Relays R = {R1, R2, ... Rr}

## Constraint
- k coverage ( each target coverage by k sensor) 
- m connectivity (each target have m path to base)

## Objective
- Cost = alpha * |R| + beta * |S| minimum
